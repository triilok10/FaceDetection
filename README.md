# FaceDetection #.Net Core

This project implements a face detection and recognition system using .NET Core for the backend, SQL for database management, and Python for face detection and recognition. It utilizes OpenCV to detect faces in images and the face_recognition library for accurate face recognition. The combination of these technologies enables a robust application that can handle user data efficiently.
